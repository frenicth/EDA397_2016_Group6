SUGGESTION 1:
PINDER (Tinder for programmers)

GOAL:
Improve productivity of pairs.

HOW:
Automatically suggesting pairs for solving a set of tasks.
	- Could perhaps get members and tasks from trello or git.

Sessions or pairs are evaluated to improve further projects/sessions.
	- this could be done either by checking efficiency through quality of code or timewise based on task completion times. 
	- Could also be done based on how the involved people evaluate the session.
